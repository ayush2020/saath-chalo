            <h5 className='scam-txt'>Password quality</h5>
            <p className='scam-txt'>Your password should be at least 8 characters with a mix of at least 1 letter, 1 number, and 1 special character (e.g. #, @, &). Having complex and unique passwords on all your accounts, not just your BlaBlaCar account, will greatly reduce the chances of having security issues.</p>

          <p className='scam-txt'>A few tips to help keep you safe online:
          • Check for “https://” and “🔒” at the beginning of a website: This means your connection is secure.
          • Check if the URL matches the BlaBlaCar website: A link in a message could look right, but if the URL doesn’t match the official website (https://www.blablacar.co.uk) — it’s a scam. Always check the page's entire url before entering your login or payment info.
          • Use only your device: Don’t create accounts or enter passwords on a device that’s not yours — like a friend’s phone or internet cafe.
          • Update your software and devices: These updates often address security risks and introduce new security protections.</p>

            <h5 className='scam-txt'>Off-site payments and messages</h5>
            <p className='scam-txt'>Tips to keep you safe while exchanging messages with other members: • Only exchange on BlaBlaCar: Do not exchange on other platforms (WhatsApp, Messenger) before booking. • Keep your personal info secure: Never share your personal information like phone number, email and payment details before booking a ride. • Don’t follow links in messages: Never click on or open a link in suspicious or unsolicited messages on the BlaBlaCar platform or third party messaging apps.</p>
